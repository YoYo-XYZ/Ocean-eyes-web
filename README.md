# 🐟 OceanEyes Web: AI Fish Monitoring & Aquarium Diagnostics Portal

OceanEyes Web is a modern, high-performance web dashboard designed to monitor smart aquariums in real-time. The application provides advanced diagnostics (pH, temperature, water clarity, chemical balances) alongside active computer vision feeds that count, classify, and track fish species in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Real-Time Diagnostics Panel**: High-fidelity monitoring of critical aquarium health indicators (pH, temperature, clarity, and chemistry metrics).
*   **AI Fish Detection & Classification**: Automated integration with computer vision models to count live fish, classify species (e.g., Neon Tetra, Guppy, Corydoras), and calculate inference confidence scores.
*   **IoT Simulator Console**: Split-screen simulator enabling developers and operators to mock data streams, inject anomalies, and verify dashboard telemetry instantly.
*   **Premium Web-Native Design**: Tailored responsive full-screen grid built with native Vanilla CSS, using a curated HSL color palette, smooth transitions, and sleek glassmorphism effects.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Library**: React 18+ (TypeScript)
*   **Build System & HMR**: Vite
*   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (CSS Custom Variables with HSL colors)
*   **Iconography**: Lucide React (`lucide-react`)
*   **Datastore/Mocking**: LocalStorage-backed simulation model (`src/services/mock_service.ts`) emulating real-time Firestore synchronization.

## 🤖 Custom AI Agent Tooling

This project integrates specialized AI assistant skills located inside the `.agents/` folder. Developers or AI assistants can invoke these tools during pair programming sessions:

### Code Review & Health Scanner
An automated static analysis scanner checks for file complexity, TypeScript `any` leaks, naming conventions, hardcoded secrets, and async error boundaries.

To execute a codebase health scan:
```bash
node .agents/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/code_health_checker.cjs
```
This utility returns details on file scale, component naming patterns, type-safety degradation, and security vulnerabilities.
